# ROI FILETREE
Welcome to ROI repository, here you can find the primordial version of the
interpreter. This file is intended to specify the file and folders structure.

- src: source codes
-- src/headers: .h files
-- src/assets: images, texts, and other aesthetic files  


# Dependencies
Only files ended with 'handler.h' can call external depencies such as stdio,
stdlib etc.


# Naming convention
Names ended with '_t' relates to structs.
CamelCase started with uppercase relates typedef structs (almost classes)
camelCase started with lowercase relates to functions
